CodeJam hosted By GDG Enugu

Today marks my first participation on anything related to competitive coding
or coding in groups. Hackaton as you may know is a competitive space for scaling 
and handling tough problems. I can't talk much about my experience cause am 
a bit high now lol they shared X1 hahaha, but it was really fun hahaha neve knew 
coding with tension and music could be thrilling cause i didnt want to come here at 
all in the first place. I was more of terrified on how bad i would perform and maybe
be descriminated for mu unpopular area of study but am ceratin that was all just in my 
head now.

I solved Q1, attempted Q2, copied Q3 and didnt understand Q4
Am sure to do better next time!!! Plus i came like 2hrs late Chai
